## Part 1: Self-Improving Skills for Claude Code

## Quick Summary

**What:** Systems that learn from user corrections and automatically improve skill definitions over time

**Why:** Eliminates repetitive teaching across sessions - Claude learns your preferences once and remembers them permanently

**When:** Use when you frequently correct Claude on project-specific patterns, team conventions, or domain-specific practices

---

## Core Approaches

### 1. Native Skills (Recommended Starting Point)

**What it is:** Built-in Claude Code pattern-based skill activation via SKILL.md files

**How it works:**
- Create `~/.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`
- Define triggers: file globs, keywords, import patterns, bash commands
- Skill auto-activates when patterns match conversation context

**Example:**
```markdown
---
name: fastapi-workflow
description: FastAPI development patterns
---

# FastAPI Workflow

**Auto-activate when:** Working with `app/` directory, importing from `fastapi`,
or when files contain `@app.get`, `APIRouter`, `Depends`.

## Patterns
- Use APIRouter for logical grouping
- Prefix routes: `/api/v1/resource`
```

**Pros:**
- Simple, low maintenance
- High explainability
- Version-controlled (git)
- Built into Claude Code

**Cons:**
- Manual trigger updates required
- Can miss edge cases

---

### 2. Hooks + Dynamic Injection (Power User)

**What it is:** Use Claude Code hooks to programmatically inject context based on runtime analysis

**How it works:**
- Write Python/Bash hook scripts
- Register in `settings.json` for events: `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `Stop`
- Hooks read conversation state, detect patterns, inject additional context

**Hook Events:**
- `UserPromptSubmit` - Before prompt processed (context injection)
- `PreToolUse` - Before tool executes (validation/guardrails)
- `PostToolUse` - After tool executes (logging/state tracking)
- `Stop` - When agent finishes (learning from session)

**Example Hook (autoskill-router.py):**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import json, sys, re
from pathlib import Path

PATTERNS = {
    'git-workflow': [re.compile(r'\b(commit|push|git)\b', re.I)],
    'docker-workflow': [re.compile(r'\b(docker|container)\b', re.I)],
}

data = json.load(sys.stdin)
prompt = data.get('prompt', '')

activated = [skill for skill, patterns in PATTERNS.items()
             if any(p.search(prompt) for p in patterns)]

if activated:
    context = "\n\n".join([
        load_skill(skill) for skill in activated
    ])
    print(json.dumps({
        "hookSpecificOutput": {"additionalContext": context}
    }))
else:
    print(json.dumps({}))
```

**Pros:**
- Dynamic, context-aware skill composition
- Can combine multiple skills programmatically
- Preprocessing/validation capabilities

**Cons:**
- More complex to debug
- Requires hook script maintenance
- Platform-specific (WSL on Windows requires `bash -l`)

---

### 3. Self-Learning Analyzer (Meta-Optimization)

**What it is:** Analyze conversation history to detect missed skill activations and auto-suggest trigger improvements

**How it works:**
1. Parse `history.jsonl` for signals (file operations, bash commands, user intents)
2. Compare signals against existing skill triggers
3. Detect gaps: "This skill should have activated but didn't"
4. Suggest new trigger patterns with confidence scores

**Your Existing Implementation:**
You already have `~/.claude/scripts/skill-analyzer.py` that does this!

**Run it:**
```bash
python ~/.claude/scripts/skill-analyzer.py --verbose --checkpoint
```

**Output:**
```
SKILL: python-workflow
  MISSED: Working with pyproject.toml (confidence: HIGH)
  SUGGEST: Add trigger: "when working with `pyproject.toml`"

SKILL: docker-workflow
  MISSED: docker-compose.yml editing (confidence: HIGH)
  SUGGEST: Add trigger: "file glob `docker-compose*.yml`"
```

**Pros:**
- Data-driven trigger refinement
- Detects patterns you didn't think of
- Low friction (just review suggestions)

**Cons:**
- Requires manual review before applying
- Only as good as signal extraction
- May suggest overly specific triggers

---

## Alternative Architectures

### ACE (Autonomous Cognitive Entity)

**Concept:** Hierarchical layers inspired by cognitive architecture

**Layers:**
1. **Aspirational** - Mission, values, ethics
2. **Global Strategy** - Long-term planning
3. **Agent Model** - Self-awareness
4. **Executive Function** - Task switching
5. **Cognitive Control** - Working memory
6. **Task Prosecution** - Execution

**Best for:** Safety-critical agents, multi-session persistence, agent-managing-agents

**Trade-off:** Complex to implement, overhead for simple tasks

---

### Voyager (Exploration-Based Skill Library)

**Concept:** Discover skills through exploration, store in growing library with embeddings

**Components:**
- **Automatic Curriculum** - Generate increasingly complex tasks
- **Skill Library** - Vector DB of learned code snippets
- **Iterative Prompting** - Refine through feedback

**Technical:**
```python
# Voyager skill library
skills = {}  # name -> {code, description}
embeddings = ChromaDB()  # Semantic search

# Add skill
skills['gather_wood'] = {
    'code': 'function gatherWood() {...}',
    'description': 'Gather 10 wood blocks'
}
embeddings.add(name, description_embedding)

# Retrieve similar
query_embedding = embed("I need to build a house")
similar = embeddings.query(query_embedding, k=5)
```

**Best for:** Open-ended exploration, capability growth over time, discovery-heavy workflows

**Trade-off:** Requires feedback mechanism, skills may drift, embedding storage overhead

---

### SAGE (Structured Agentic Generation)

**Concept:** Explicit reasoning with typed tool calls and structured outputs

**Components:**
- Pydantic schemas for tool calls
- Chain-of-thought before actions
- Typed tool registry

**Example:**
```python
class ToolCall(BaseModel):
    tool: Literal['read_file', 'write_file', 'run_bash']
    parameters: dict
    reasoning: str  # Why this tool?

class SAGEResponse(BaseModel):
    thought: str
    tool_calls: list[ToolCall]
    final_answer: str | None
```

**Best for:** Production APIs, auditability requirements, predictable outputs

**Trade-off:** Less flexible, schema maintenance

---

## Comparison Matrix

| Approach | Complexity | Learning | Safety | Auditability | Context Cost |
|----------|------------|----------|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Native Skills** | Low | Manual | Good | High | Low |
| **Hooks + Injection** | Medium | Manual | Good | High | Variable |
| **Self-Learning** | Medium | Auto | Medium | Medium | Low |
| **ACE** | High | Manual | Excellent | High | High |
| **Voyager** | High | Auto | Low | Medium | High (embeddings) |
| **SAGE** | Medium | Manual | Good | Excellent | Medium |

---

## Implementation Guide

### Phase 1: Native Skills (Start Here)

```bash
# 1. Create skill directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/my-skill

# 2. Write SKILL.md
cat > ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: my-skill
description: Custom project patterns
---

# My Skill

**Auto-activate when:** Working with `src/**/*.ts`, importing from `@/lib`,
or when user mentions "project pattern".

## Patterns
- Always use named exports, not default
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Anti-Patterns
- Don't use `any` type - use `unknown` instead
EOF

# 3. Test activation
# Start Claude Code, write prompt that should trigger
```

### Phase 2: Add Hooks for Dynamic Behavior

```bash
# 1. Create hook script
cat > ~/.claude/hooks/autoskill-router.py << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env python
import json, sys, re
from pathlib import Path

data = json.load(sys.stdin)
prompt = data.get('prompt', '')

# Detect patterns
if re.search(r'\bfastapi\b', prompt, re.I):
    skill = (Path.home() / '.claude/skills/fastapi-workflow/SKILL.md').read_text()
    print(json.dumps({
        "hookSpecificOutput": {"additionalContext": skill}
    }))
else:
    print(json.dumps({}))
EOF

chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/autoskill-router.py

# 2. Register hook in settings.json
cat > ~/.claude/settings.json << 'EOF'
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{
      "matcher": ".*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "bash -l -c 'python ~/.claude/hooks/autoskill-router.py'"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
EOF
```

### Phase 3: Enable Self-Learning

```bash
# Run analyzer periodically (you already have this!)
python ~/.claude/scripts/skill-analyzer.py --verbose --checkpoint

# Review output, manually apply approved trigger additions
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Problem | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Overly broad triggers** | Skill activates when irrelevant | Make patterns more specific, use negative lookahead |
| **ZDOTDIR not set** | Skills don't load on MSYS2 | Use `${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}` in paths |
| **Hook not executing** | No context injection | Use `bash -l` for login shell, check PATH |
| **CRLF line endings** | Hook fails with `\r` error | Enforce LF in `.gitattributes` |
| **Meta-overfitting** | Self-learning captures one-offs | Require 2+ repetitions or explicit rule language |
| **Context collapse** | Summarization loses critical details | Use structured updates, preserve examples |

---

---

## Integration: Context Maintenance + Self-Learning

This autoskill research complements the **context-maintenance system** described in `claude/ideas/context-maintenance/PLAN.md`. Together they form a complete self-improving loop:

### Learning from Two Sources

**1. Session Corrections (Autoskill)**
- Analyzes conversation transcripts for user corrections
- Detects patterns: "use X instead of Y", repeated feedback
- Updates skill triggers based on corrections

**2. Actual Work (Context Maintenance)**
- Analyzes git commit history for emerging patterns
- Detects conventions after 3+ occurrences
- Drafts CLAUDE.md/skill updates from real code

### Combined Architecture

```
Session → Hooks inject context (state delta + summaries)
    ↓
Claude works (with current project state)
    ↓
User corrections → Autoskill learns (transcript analysis)
    ↓
Work committed → Git automation extracts (commit analysis)
    ↓
Patterns compound in skills/CLAUDE.md (structured)
    ↓
Old context archived (forgetting as technology)
    ↓
Memory health tracked monthly (compounding metrics)
```

### Key Enhancements from Context-Maintenance Plan

1. **State Delta Awareness**: Hooks inject "what changed since last session" (git commits, completions)
2. **Two-Stage Retrieval**: Recall candidates (summaries), then verify (read files with specific lines)
3. **Lifecycle Metadata**: Classify sections as permanent/temporary/ephemeral for proper archival
4. **Forgetting as Technology**: Archive STATUS.md entries >90 days old to keep context focused
5. **Memory Health Metrics**: Monthly tracking of compounding (patterns reused, lessons applied)

### Why This Matters

The context-maintenance plan implements the **8 principles of memory architecture** from academic research:
1. Memory is architecture, not a feature
2. Separate by lifecycle (personal/project/session)
3. Match storage to query pattern (key-value/structured/semantic/logs)
4. Mode-aware context beats volume (planning vs execution vs debug)
5. Build portable first (markdown + git survives vendor changes)
6. Compression is curation (inject summaries, not full files)
7. Retrieval needs verification (recall + verify, not just inject)
8. Memory compounds through structure (not random accumulation)

These principles validate and enhance the autoskill approaches described above.

**Recommendation**: Implement autoskill (learning from corrections) AND context-maintenance (learning from commits) for maximum compounding.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill definitions |
| `~/.claude/scripts/skill-analyzer.py` | Self-learning analyzer (you have this!) |
| `~/.claude/hooks/*.py` | Hook scripts |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | Hook registration |
| `~/.claude/history.jsonl` | Conversation history for analysis |
| `claude/ideas/context-maintenance/PLAN.md` | Full context-maintenance system plan |

---

## Recommended Path for You

Based on your experience level and existing infrastructure:

1. **Start:** Review your existing skills in `~/.claude/skills/`
2. **Optimize:** Run `skill-analyzer.py` to detect missed activations
3. **Apply:** Add suggested triggers to SKILL.md files
4. **Extend:** Create hooks for dynamic behavior (e.g., project-type detection)
5. **Monitor:** Re-run analyzer monthly to refine triggers

You already have the foundation built - just activate the self-learning loop!

## Part 2: Context Maintenance System - Implementation Plan

**Created**: 2025-01-24
**Problem**: Claude doesn't check existing context (STATUS.md, CLAUDE.md, skills) before acting, leading to pattern violations and out-of-date documentation
**Solution**: Three-tier approach combining hooks, git automation, and plan mode integration

---

## Problem Analysis

Based on user feedback and exploration:

1. **STATUS.md gets stale** - Updated manually after work, often forgotten during rapid iteration
2. **CLAUDE.md doesn't reflect new patterns** - Project conventions change but aren't documented
3. **Skills don't auto-update** - Patterns emerge from code but aren't extracted to skills
4. **Claude ignores context** - Jumps to solutions without reading existing docs (15% check rate)
5. **Plans don't include context updates** - Not treated as deliverables, so they don't happen

**Result**: Violated patterns, duplicate work, wrong priorities, stale documentation

---

## Recommended Solution: Multi-Tier Integration

### Tier 1: Hook-Based Context Prompting (Behavioral)
**Goal**: Force Claude to see context before acting

### Tier 2: Git-Based Automation (Maintenance)
**Goal**: Auto-maintain STATUS.md/CLAUDE.md from actual commits

### Tier 3: Plan Mode Integration (Process)
**Goal**: Make context updates explicit deliverables in every plan

---

## Tier 1: Hook-Based Context Prompting

### Overview
Use `UserPromptSubmit` hooks to inject context summaries before Claude sees the prompt. Creates "speed bump" that makes context impossible to miss.

### Architecture

**Hook File**: `~/.claude/hooks/inject-context.py`

**Trigger**: Every prompt in projects with `.claude/` directory

**Execution Time**: <100ms (parses first 100 lines of STATUS.md, first 5KB of CLAUDE.md)

### What Gets Injected

**Tier 1 (Universal - ~150 tokens)**:
```
═══ CONTEXT CHECKPOINT ═══
Project: agent-spike | Updated: 2025-11-24
Phase: Personal AI Research Assistant

📋 STATUS.md exists - Current state, blockers, next steps
📖 CLAUDE.md exists - Project patterns, architecture rules
🎯 VISION.md exists - Long-term roadmap

⚠️ REQUIRED BEFORE CHANGES:
  1. Check STATUS.md for current phase
  2. Check CLAUDE.md for existing patterns
  3. State findings in response
═══════════════════════════
```

**Tier 2 (Intent-Specific - additional 150-250 tokens)**:

- **Code modification** detected (keywords: implement, add, create, modify, fix):
  ```
  🔨 CODE MODIFICATION DETECTED
  Check STATUS.md (current phase, blockers, recent completions)
  Check CLAUDE.md (service patterns, file locations, architecture)
  RESPOND: "Checked [file] - [finding]" before proposing code.
  ```

- **Planning** detected (keywords: design, plan, architect, approach):
  ```
  📐 PLANNING DETECTED
  Review VISION.md + STATUS.md (design decisions made) + active skills
  RESPOND: "Reviewed [context] - following [pattern]" before design.
  ```

- **Debugging** detected (keywords: why, error, failing, broken, debug):
  ```
  🐛 DEBUGGING DETECTED
  Check STATUS.md "Known Issues" + git log + existing error patterns
  RESPOND: "Checked [source] - [finding]" before fix.
  ```

- **Git operations** detected (keywords: commit, push, git):
  ```
  🔀 GIT OPERATION DETECTED
  Security scan + STATUS.md alignment + git-workflow skill active
  ```

### Intent Classification

Simple keyword matching:
```python
def classify_intent(prompt: str) -> list[str]:
    p = prompt.lower()
    intents = []

    if any(kw in p for kw in ['commit', 'push', 'git']):
        intents.append('git')
    if any(kw in p for kw in ['implement', 'add', 'create', 'modify', 'fix']):
        intents.append('code')
    if any(kw in p for kw in ['design', 'plan', 'architect', 'approach']):
        intents.append('planning')
    if any(kw in p for kw in ['why', 'error', 'failing', 'broken', 'debug']):
        intents.append('debug')

    return intents or ['default']
```

### Realistic Expectations

**Baseline** (no hooks):
- Claude checks context: ~15% of time
- Pattern violations: 8-10/week
- User corrections: 10-12/week

**With hooks** (after 2-3 weeks):
- Claude checks context: ~60-70% of time (4x improvement)
- Pattern violations: 2-3/week (70% reduction)
- User corrections: 3-4/week (65% reduction)

**Never reaches 100%**: Claude is probabilistic. Will occasionally skip context despite prompting.

### Implementation Files

1. **`~/.claude/hooks/inject-context.py`** (new)
   - Intent classification
   - STATUS.md/CLAUDE.md parsing
   - Context injection formatting

2. **`~/.claude/hooks/hooks.json`** (modify)
   - Register inject-context hook
   - No matchers = runs on all prompts

3. **`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`** (modify)
   - Add "Context Verification Protocol" section
   - Explicit instruction to read hook summaries first

4. **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`** (modify)
   - Add "Required Reading" section
   - Link to hook behavior

### Trade-offs

**Advantages**:
- Zero user overhead (automatic)
- Consistent application (every prompt)
- Intent-aware (different warnings for different tasks)
- Fast iteration (update hook → affects all projects)

**Disadvantages**:
- Token cost (~150-400 per prompt = $0.0001 each)
- No guarantee (Claude can still ignore)
- Notification fatigue (brain tunes out repetition)
- False positives (intent misclassification)

**Mitigation**:
- Vary wording to prevent tuning out
- Keep summaries compact (<350 tokens avg)
- Tune keywords based on usage
- Combine with explicit ruleset instructions

---

## Tier 2: Git-Based Automation

### Overview
Use git hooks (post-commit, post-merge) to automatically update STATUS.md and draft CLAUDE.md/skill updates based on actual commits.

### Architecture

**Hooks**:
- **post-commit**: Immediate updates (Git State section, <5 seconds)
- **post-merge**: Batch processing (Recent Completions, design decisions, <10 seconds)

### Commit Analysis Engine

**File**: `.githooks/lib/commit_analyzer.py`

**Extracts**:
```python
@dataclass
class CommitAnalysis:
    sha: str
    type: str  # feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore
    scope: str | None
    subject: str
    files_changed: list[str]

    # Detected patterns
    new_services: list[str]
    new_protocols: list[str]
    migrations: list[str]

    # Significance flags
    is_design_decision: bool
    is_new_pattern: bool
    affects_skills: list[str]
    completion_summary: str | None
```

**Pattern Detection**:
- New protocols: `grep 'class.*Protocol:' diff`
- New services: New files in `compose/services/*/`
- Design decisions: Commit body >100 chars with rationale
- Migrations: Message contains "migrate", diffs show old→new
- Completions: Message contains "complete", tests passing
- Skill relevance: File paths match skill activation patterns

### STATUS.md Updates

#### A. Git State Section (AUTO-UPDATE)

**Always safe, fast update**:
```markdown
## Git State
- Branch: main
- Recent commits (2025-11-24):
  - 5418aaa - docs: add proactive memory system design
  - 65ca4b8 - feat: add archive-to-MinIO migration script
- Status: Clean working tree
```

**Updates**: Every post-commit (<200ms)
**Safety**: Backed up before update, changes staged for next commit

#### B. Recent Completions (DRAFT MODE)

**Completion detection**:
1. Multiple commits with same scope
2. Final commit contains "complete" or "tests passing"
3. No new commits in scope for 2+ hours

**Output**: Draft at `.claude/context-updates/YYYYMMDD-completion.md`

**Example auto-generated**:
```markdown
**URL Pattern Analytics SurrealDB Migration** ✅ COMPLETE (2025-11-24)
- Added AsyncPatternTracker protocol and SurrealDB models
- Extracted pattern matching logic to pure functions
- Implemented SurrealDB repository for analytics
- Created TDD test suite (27 tests)
- 6 commits, all tests passing
```

**User workflow**: Review draft → manually add to STATUS.md → delete draft

#### C. Lesson Progress (AUTO-DETECT)

**Detects**:
- COMPLETE.md file created in `lessons/lesson-XXX/`
- Commit message: "complete lesson X"
- Tests passing in lesson directory

**Auto-updates**:
- Increment lesson count
- Add to "Completed Lessons" section

### CLAUDE.md Updates

#### Pattern Detection

**File**: `.githooks/lib/pattern_detector.py`

**Detects**:

1. **Design Decisions** (commit body >100 chars):
   ```python
   DesignDecision(
       title="Optimize git hooks for performance",
       rationale="Pre-commit scanning 1,633 files took 75 seconds",
       solution="Only scan staged files (1-5 files typically)",
       suggested_section="## Git Hooks",
       draft_file=".claude/context-updates/20251124-claude-githooks.md"
   )
   ```

2. **Conventions** (3+ commits with pattern):
   ```python
   Convention(
       pattern="Async* prefix for async protocols",
       occurrences=5,
       examples=["AsyncPatternTracker", "AsyncCacheManager"],
       suggested_update="Add to Python Workflow section"
   )
   ```

**Output**: Always drafts for user review, never auto-commits to CLAUDE.md

### Skill Updates

**File**: `.githooks/lib/skill_matcher.py`

**Maps file changes to skills**:
```python
SKILL_PATTERNS = {
    "agent-spike-project": {
        "paths": ["compose/services/**", "compose/cli/**"],
        "keywords": ["service", "protocol", "archive"]
    },
    "python-workflow": {
        "paths": ["**/*.py", "pyproject.toml"],
        "keywords": ["uv", "pytest", "protocol"]
    }
}
```

**When patterns emerge** (3+ uses in different contexts):
- Generates draft at `.claude/context-updates/YYYYMMDD-skill-NAME.md`
- Includes suggested text with examples
- User reviews → applies → deletes draft

### Safety Mechanisms

**Backups**:
```python
def backup_file(filepath: Path) -> Path:
    """Create timestamped backup before EVERY update."""
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
    backup = filepath.parent / f"{filepath.name}.bak.{timestamp}"
    shutil.copy(filepath, backup)
    return backup  # Keep last 5 backups
```

**Auto-stage, NOT auto-commit**:
```bash
# Update + stage, user commits when ready
git add .claude/STATUS.md
echo "[post-commit] STATUS.md updated and staged"
# No git commit = user retains control
```

**Loop prevention**:
```python
# Skip automation for doc-only commits
if commit_msg.startswith("docs: auto-update"):
    exit(0)
```

### Performance Budget

- Pre-commit: <2 sec (blocks user)
- Post-commit: <5 sec (user waits)
- Post-merge: <10 sec (batch OK)

**Optimizations**:
- Skip commits with no relevant files
- Background processing (non-blocking)
- Incremental (only new commits)
- Caching (reuse analysis results)

### Implementation Files

1. **`.githooks/post-commit`** (new) - Main automation trigger
2. **`.githooks/lib/commit_analyzer.py`** (new) - Core analysis engine
3. **`.githooks/lib/status_updater.py`** (new) - STATUS.md automation
4. **`.githooks/lib/pattern_detector.py`** (new) - CLAUDE.md intelligence
5. **`.githooks/lib/skill_matcher.py`** (new) - Skill synchronization
6. **`.githooks/config.json`** (new) - User control settings

### Trade-offs

**Advantages**:
- STATUS.md always current (Git State auto-updated)
- Zero manual overhead (runs on every commit)
- Patterns captured (design decisions, conventions)
- Historical accuracy (derived from git, not memory)

**Disadvantages**:
- Heuristics not perfect (may miss patterns)
- Requires review (drafts, not auto-commits)
- Performance cost (5 seconds per commit)
- Maintenance (tune heuristics over time)

**Automation Levels**:
- **Conservative**: Git State only auto-updated
- **Balanced** (RECOMMENDED): Git State auto, everything else drafted
- **Aggressive**: Everything auto-committed (not recommended)

## Tier 3: Plan Mode Integration

### Overview
Make every plan explicitly include STATUS.md/CLAUDE.md updates as deliverables and specify commit boundaries throughout work.

### Enhanced Plan Template

**Location**: `~/.claude/plan-templates/default.md` (new)

**Structure**:
```markdown
# [Feature Name] - Implementation Plan

## Context Baseline
**STATUS.md current state**: [One-line summary]
**CLAUDE.md patterns**: [Relevant existing patterns]
**Active session**: [.session/feature/X if exists]

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: [Name] (est. Xm)
**What**: [Implementation work]
**Commit point**: YES/NO + message if yes
**Context update**: NONE | STATUS | CLAUDE | BOTH
  - If STATUS: What to document
  - If CLAUDE: What pattern to capture

[Repeat for each phase]

## Context Deliverables (REQUIRED)

### STATUS.md Updates
**When**: After phases [X, Y]
**What to document**:
- Completion entry with date
- Key decisions
- Next steps

### CLAUDE.md Updates
**Trigger**: IF new patterns emerged
**Patterns to consider**: [List]
**Action**: Add to [section] OR extract to skill

### Skills Review
**Check if**: Work creates reusable patterns (≥3 uses)
**Candidate patterns**: [List if any]
**Action**: Extract OR document in CLAUDE.md

## Commit Boundaries (DISTRIBUTED)

| After Phase | Type | Message | Push |
|-------------|------|---------|------|
| Phase 1 | feat | Add X service | NO |
| Phase 3 | test | Add tests | NO |
| Phase 4 | docs | Update STATUS.md | YES |

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All phases implemented
- [ ] STATUS.md updated
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated (if needed)
- [ ] Skills extracted (if ≥3 patterns)
- [ ] Commits at boundaries
- [ ] Working tree clean
```

### When to Update What

**STATUS.md** - Update when:
- Feature/lesson completes (completion entry)
- Major phase completes (progress entry)
- Blocked on something (blocker entry)
- Multi-day work resumes

**CLAUDE.md** - Update when:
- New project-wide pattern emerges
- Architecture decision made
- Development workflow changes
- Anti-pattern discovered

**Skills** - Extract when:
- Pattern used ≥3 times across different contexts
- Generic enough for other projects
- Non-trivial enough to forget

### Example: Before vs After

**BEFORE**:
```
## Implementation
1. Backend service (30m)
2. Frontend UI (30m)

## Commits
1. feat(backend): add service
2. feat(frontend): add UI
```

**AFTER**:
```
## Phase 1: Backend (30m)
Commit: YES - feat(backend): add service
Context: NONE

## Phase 2: Frontend (30m)
Commit: YES - feat(frontend): add UI
Context: NONE

## Phase 3: Finalize (15m)
Commit: YES - docs: update STATUS.md
Context: STATUS (completion entry)

## Context Deliverables
- STATUS.md: Add completion after Phase 3
- CLAUDE.md: Check if storage pattern novel
- Skills: Review if ≥3 uses

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All phases done
- [ ] STATUS.md updated
- [ ] 3 commits created
```

**Result**: Logical commits throughout, STATUS.md stays current, patterns captured

### Implementation Files

1. **`~/.claude/plan-templates/default.md`** (new) - Enhanced template
2. **`~/.claude/commands/review-skills-from-plan.md`** (new) - Skill extraction automation
3. **`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`** (modify) - Document pattern as default
4. **Plan mode system prompt** (optional, high risk) - Enforce context sections

### Trade-offs

**Advantages**:
- Completeness (all work in plan)
- Better git history (logical commits)
- Pattern discoverability (documented)
- Future resumability (context current)

**Disadvantages**:
- Slightly more verbose plans
- More upfront planning overhead
- Requires discipline

**Mitigation**: Keep terse (bullets not prose), becomes automatic after 2-3 uses, verification checklist enforces

## Additional Research Item

**Video reviewed**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdJE6_OU3YA
- Topic: AI memory systems architecture
- Speaker's thesis: "AI systems are stateless by design but useful intelligence requires state"
- **Status**: Reviewed (2025-01-24)
- **Verdict**: Strongly validates our 3-tier approach, adds critical enhancements

## Research Validation: Memory Systems Video Insights

### The 8 Principles of Memory Architecture (Applied to Our Design)

**Video source**: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdJE6_OU3YA)

The speaker outlines why AI memory is "the biggest unsolved problem in AI" and provides 8 principles for solving it. Here's how they validate and enhance our design:

#### 1. Memory is Architecture, Not a Feature
**Their principle**: "Don't wait for vendors to solve this - you need to design it yourself"
**Our implementation**: 3-tier system (hooks + git + plan mode) is architectural, not waiting for Claude Code features

#### 2. Separate by Lifecycle, Not Convenience
**Their principle**: "Personal preferences (permanent) ≠ project facts (temporary) ≠ session state (ephemeral)"
**Our implementation**: Already separated:
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (personal-permanent)
- `.claude/STATUS.md` (project-temporary)
- `.session/feature/*` (ephemeral)

#### 3. Match Storage to Query Pattern
**Their principle**: "Different questions need different retrieval - key-value, structured, semantic, event logs"
**Our implementation**: Multiple stores:
- CLAUDE.md rules (key-value)
- STATUS.md sections (structured)
- Skills (semantic patterns)
- Git history (event logs)

#### 4. Mode-Aware Context Beats Volume
**Their principle**: "Planning needs breadth, execution needs precision - retrieval must match task type"
**Our implementation**: Hook intent detection (planning/code/debug/git) injects mode-specific context

#### 5. Build Portable First
**Their principle**: "Memory must survive vendor/tool/model changes"
**Our implementation**: Markdown + git = portable across any AI system

#### 6. Compression is Curation
**Their principle**: "Do not upload 40 pages hoping AI extracts what matters - you do the compression work"
**Our implementation**: Hooks inject summaries (first 100 lines), not full files; git automation drafts for human curation

#### 7. Retrieval Needs Verification
**Their principle**: "Semantic search recalls well but fails on specifics - pair fuzzy retrieval with exact verification"
**Our implementation**: Partial - hooks recall (inject summaries), Claude verifies (reads files), but not explicit

#### 8. Memory Compounds Through Structure
**Their principle**: "Random accumulation creates noise - structured memory compounds without degradation"
**Our implementation**: Structured: STATUS.md (chronological), CLAUDE.md (principles), skills (patterns)

## Enhancements from Video Insights

### Enhancement 1: State Delta Awareness (NEW)

**Problem**: "What changed since last time" is crucial for relevance but not surfaced
**Video insight**: "Relevance changes based on state delta - what's new since you last talked"

**Implementation**: Add to Tier 1 hooks

**Updated injection** (Tier 1):
```
═══ CONTEXT CHECKPOINT ═══
Project: agent-spike | Updated: 2025-11-24
Phase: Personal AI Research Assistant

Since last session (2025-01-23):
├─ 12 commits (feat: 8, fix: 2, docs: 2)
├─ New: SurrealDB PatternTracker complete
├─ Changed: URL filtering migrated to async
└─ Active: 2 sessions (mentat, message-bus)

📋 STATUS.md - Current state, blockers, next steps
📖 CLAUDE.md - Project patterns, architecture
🎯 VISION.md - Long-term roadmap

⚠️ CHECK BEFORE CHANGES: What's changed?
═══════════════════════════
```

**Code changes**:
```python
def get_state_delta(status_md: Path, git_dir: Path) -> dict:
    """Extract what changed since last Claude session."""

    # Read last session timestamp from cache
    cache = git_dir / ".claude" / ".last-session"
    last_session = read_timestamp(cache) if cache.exists() else "1 day ago"

    # Git commits since then
    commits = git("log", f"--since={last_session}", "--oneline", "--format=%s")
    commit_count = len(commits.split('\n'))

    # Categorize commits
    feat_count = len([c for c in commits if c.startswith('feat')])
    fix_count = len([c for c in commits if c.startswith('fix')])
    docs_count = len([c for c in commits if c.startswith('docs')])

    # Parse STATUS.md for recent completions
    recent = extract_recent_completion(status_md)

    # Active sessions
    sessions = list((git_dir / ".session" / "feature").iterdir())

    return {
        "commit_count": commit_count,
        "feat": feat_count,
        "fix": fix_count,
        "docs": docs_count,
        "recent_completion": recent,
        "active_sessions": [s.name for s in sessions]
    }
```

**Update cache after each session**:
```python
# In inject-context.py, after generating context
cache_file = Path(cwd) / ".claude" / ".last-session"
cache_file.write_text(datetime.now().isoformat())
```

---

### Enhancement 2: Forgetting as Technology (NEW)

**Problem**: STATUS.md accumulates indefinitely, older entries become noise
**Video insight**: "Human memory uses forgetting as technology - lossy compression with importance weighting"

**Solution**: Automatic archival of old STATUS.md entries

**Implementation**: Add to Tier 2 git automation

**New file**: `.githooks/lib/status_archiver.py`

```python
def archive_old_entries(status_md: Path, archive_md: Path, age_threshold_days: int = 90):
    """
    Move STATUS.md entries older than threshold to archive.

    Keeps STATUS.md focused on recent work (last 3 months).
    Archived entries still retrievable if needed.
    """

    # Parse STATUS.md into dated sections
    sections = parse_dated_sections(status_md)

    cutoff = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=age_threshold_days)

    # Separate recent from old
    recent = [s for s in sections if s.date > cutoff]
    old = [s for s in sections if s.date <= cutoff]

    if not old:
        return  # Nothing to archive

    # Backup before modifying
    backup_file(status_md)

    # Write recent to STATUS.md
    with open(status_md, 'w') as f:
        f.write(format_sections(recent))
        f.write(f"\n---\n\n**Older entries**: See STATUS_ARCHIVE.md\n")

    # Append old to STATUS_ARCHIVE.md
    with open(archive_md, 'a') as f:
        f.write(f"\n## Archived {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m')}\n\n")
        f.write(format_sections(old))

    # Stage changes
    git("add", str(status_md), str(archive_md))
```

**Trigger**: Monthly cron job or manual command

```bash
# Add to Makefile
archive-status:
	uv run python .githooks/lib/status_archiver.py

# Or git hook: post-commit (runs monthly check)
```

**Lifecycle metadata** (add to STATUS.md sections):

```markdown
## Recent Completions (Lifecycle: temporary, archive: 3 months)

**URL Pattern Analytics** ✅ COMPLETE (2025-01-24)
- [details]
```

---

### Enhancement 3: Explicit Two-Stage Retrieval (IMPROVED)

**Problem**: Hooks inject summaries but don't force verification step
**Video insight**: "Recall candidates, then verify against ground truth"

**Solution**: Make verification explicit in hook output

**Updated Tier 1 injection**:

```
🔨 CODE MODIFICATION DETECTED

Found 3 relevant context entries:
├─ STATUS.md line 45: Current phase (SurrealDB migration)
├─ CLAUDE.md line 120: Service pattern (protocol-first)
└─ git log: Last 5 commits touch this area

⚠️ VERIFICATION REQUIRED:
1. Read STATUS.md lines 45-60 for phase details
2. Read CLAUDE.md lines 120-150 for service pattern
3. Review git diff for recent changes

RESPOND: "Verified [file:line] - [specific finding]" before code.
```

**Force specificity**:
- Not "Checked STATUS.md" (vague)
- But "Verified STATUS.md:45 - Phase 4 complete, Phase 5 starting" (specific)

---

### Enhancement 4: Lifecycle Metadata (NEW)

**Problem**: No explicit markers for how long context should persist
**Video insight**: "Separate by lifecycle - permanent vs temporary vs ephemeral"

**Solution**: Add lifecycle metadata to sections

**Format**:
```markdown
## Section Name
**Lifecycle**: permanent | temporary | ephemeral
**Review**: quarterly | monthly | after-completion
**Archive**: never | 3-months | 1-year
```

**Examples**:

```markdown
## Development Philosophy
**Lifecycle**: permanent (applies to all projects)
**Review**: quarterly
**Archive**: never

---

## Current Phase: SurrealDB Migration
**Lifecycle**: temporary (project-specific)
**Review**: weekly
**Archive**: 3-months after completion

---

## Active Session: mentat
**Lifecycle**: ephemeral (single feature)
**Review**: per-session
**Archive**: after merge
```

**Git automation enhancement**: Detect lifecycle and auto-archive accordingly

---

### Enhancement 5: Memory Compounding Metrics (NEW)

**Problem**: No way to measure if memory is actually compounding
**Video insight**: "Memory compounds through structure - measure the accumulation"

**Metrics to track**:

```markdown
## Memory Health (Auto-generated monthly)

**Status as of 2025-01-24**:

Structure metrics:
├─ STATUS.md entries: 24 (last 3 months)
├─ CLAUDE.md patterns: 18 documented
├─ Skills: 3 project, 15 personal
└─ Archived entries: 47 (still retrievable)

Compounding metrics:
├─ Patterns reused: 12 (referenced 3+ times)
├─ Decisions stable: 15 (unchanged 6+ months)
├─ Lessons applied: 8 (prevented duplicate work)
└─ Context check rate: 64% (up from 15% baseline)

Quality indicators:
├─ Pattern violations: 2/week (was 10/week)
├─ User corrections: 3/week (was 12/week)
├─ Stale context: <1 day (was 1 week)
└─ Coverage: 94% (work has context)
```

**Generate monthly with**:
```bash
make memory-health
```

## Key Insights from Memory Systems Research

**Most important validation**: Our 3-tier approach aligns with the 8 principles of memory architecture from active research.

**Most important addition**: State delta tracking ("what changed since last time") dramatically improves relevance.

**Most important technique**: "Forgetting as technology" via archival keeps STATUS.md focused on recent work.

**Speaker's challenge**: "If you solve memory now, you have an agentic AI edge. Memory compounds through structure."

**Our answer**: We're building exactly that - structured, portable, mode-aware memory that compounds without degradation.

---

## Final Assessment

**Will this work?** Yes, with realistic expectations.

**What it solves**:
- Stale STATUS.md → Automated updates from git
- Stale CLAUDE.md → Automated pattern detection
- Claude ignoring context → Forced visibility via hooks
- Missing patterns → Systematic extraction
- Plans without context → Template enforcement

**What it doesn't solve**:
- 100% compliance (Claude is probabilistic)
- Zero manual review (drafts need approval)
- Perfect pattern detection (heuristics have limits)

**Success depends on**:
1. Hook implementation quality (fast, accurate)
2. STATUS.md maintenance (kept current)
3. User reinforcement (correct Claude when it skips)
4. Iteration (tune based on data)

**Recommendation**: Build in phases, measure each, proceed if valuable.

**Total Estimated Time**: 20-28 hours over 4 weeks

## Appendix A: Research Vault Design Notes

These notes capture design philosophy and lessons learned from structuring the original research vault. Preserved for reference.

### Implementation Decisions

#### Why Python + SQLite (Not Custom DB)

**Alternatives considered:**
- PostgreSQL - Overkill, requires server
- Vector DB only (ChromaDB, Pinecone) - Missing structured queries
- JSON files - Slow queries, no relationship queries
- Full-text search (Elasticsearch) - Complex, heavy

**Why SQLite wins for MVP:**
- **Simple**: Built into Python, no setup
- **Fast**: Efficient for 1000s of notes
- **Portable**: Single .db file, works anywhere
- **Queryable**: Full SQL for complex queries
- **Incrementally upgradable**: Can add ChromaDB later for embeddings

#### Why CLI Tools (Not Web UI)

**Alternatives considered:**
- Web UI (Flask/FastAPI + React)
- VS Code extension
- Obsidian plugin

**Why CLI wins for MVP:**
- **Faster to build**: Hours vs days
- **Terminal workflow**: Fits developer workflow
- **Scriptable**: Can be called from other tools
- **Upgradeable**: Can wrap in MCP server or web UI later
- **No complexity**: No frontend build, auth, hosting

#### Why Explicit Re-Index (Not Auto-Watch)

**Alternatives considered:**
- File system watcher (watchdog) - Auto-rebuild on save
- Git hook - Rebuild on commit
- Background service - Always running

**Why explicit re-index wins for MVP:**
- **Simpler**: No daemon, no event handling
- **Predictable**: User controls when index updates
- **Debuggable**: Can see exactly when indexing happens
- **Upgradeable**: Can add `--watch` mode later

**Trade-off accepted**: User must remember to rebuild after editing

### Design Principles

#### 1. Start Simple, Enhance Incrementally

**User's approach:**
- MVP first: Structure + basic indexing
- Add features when pain points emerge
- Don't build what might be needed

**Anti-pattern to avoid:**
- Building full Obsidian clone upfront
- Adding graph viz before having 50+ notes
- Semantic search before keyword search proves insufficient

#### 2. Structure Enables Tools (Not Vice Versa)

**Correct order:**
1. Define structured format (YAML frontmatter, wikilinks)
2. Migrate existing content to format
3. Build tools that leverage structure

**Wrong order:**
1. Build tool that tries to extract structure from unstructured content
2. Hope it works well enough
3. Realize limitations and restructure anyway

**Key insight**: Pay upfront cost of structured metadata, get tools for free

#### 3. Tools Should Feel Invisible

**Good tool UX:**
```bash
# Fast enough to not think about
python _tools/search.py "hooks"  # <100ms
```

**Bad tool UX:**
```bash
# Slow enough to be annoying
python _tools/search.py "hooks"  # 5 seconds
# User gives up and uses grep
```

**Design goal**: Tools should be faster/better than manual alternatives, not just "automated"

#### 4. Validate Early, Catch Drift

**Validator as quality gate:**
- Broken links caught immediately
- Orphaned notes highlighted
- Missing metadata flagged

**Prevents:**
- Links breaking as notes rename
- Notes becoming isolated (forgotten)
- Inconsistent metadata creep

**Pattern**: Run validator after bulk edits, before commits

### Lessons Learned

#### What Works:

**Structured metadata upfront:**
- YAML frontmatter forces consistency
- Makes tooling possible
- Small upfront cost, big long-term benefit

**Simple tools first:**
- SQLite + Python is plenty for MVP
- CLI faster to build than web UI
- Can always upgrade later

**Explicit relationships:**
- Wikilinks make connections clear
- Easier to reason about than inferred links
- Validation catches mistakes

#### What to Avoid:

**Gold-plating:**
- Don't add features before pain points emerge
- Semantic search not needed for 10 notes
- Graph viz not useful until 50+ notes

**Over-automation:**
- Manual re-index is fine for MVP
- Watch mode adds complexity for little gain
- Let user control when things happen

**Tool complexity:**
- Simple grep-like search beats complex query language
- Three focused tools (index, search, validate) beats one monolith
- CLI args easier than config files for MVP

### Original Discussion Quotes

**On structure:**
> "I'm thinking that research/ directory ends up like an obsidian vault over time"

**On MVP:**
> "Do not gold plate things... this is an mvp."

**On tooling:**
> "does this structure support us adding tooling via python scripts and services in the future that would possibly help you to discover links and retrieval info without needing to search/grep every document"

**On consolidation:**
> "I would like to consolidate this under research/ though and provide you with a guide for more structure under research going forward."
